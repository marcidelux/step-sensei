Chess has a history of more than a thousand years: its roots lead back to India, from where it spread during the Middle Ages through Persia and the Arab world to Europe. Over the centuries, the rules of the game evolved until it reached its present form and became a symbol of strategic thinking.

The uniqueness of chess lies in the fact that it requires logical insight, foresight, and creativity at the same time. Every game presents a new challenge, where players must constantly weigh their options, think several moves ahead, and find the best strategy for the given situation.

It is no coincidence that chess is known worldwide as a “gym for the mind”: it develops concentration, problem-solving ability, as well as strategic and critical thinking — skills that can be useful in many areas of life.
