Chess has a history of more than a thousand years: its roots lead back to India, from where it spread to Europe during the Middle Ages through Persia and the Arab world. Over the centuries, the rules of the game gradually evolved until they reached their modern form, making chess a symbol of strategic thinking.

What makes chess special is that it requires **logical insight, foresight, and creativity** all at once. Every game presents a unique challenge in which the player must constantly weigh their options, think several moves ahead, and find the best strategy for the given situation.

It is no coincidence that chess is known worldwide as a “gym for the mind”: it develops **concentration, problem-solving skills, strategic and critical thinking** —all abilities that are useful in many areas of life.
