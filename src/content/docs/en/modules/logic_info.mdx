In the LogicInfo program, we develop logical and creative thinking and problem-solving in a **personalized and playful way** for learners of any age.

Through interactive, experience-based sessions, we help our students find creative solutions to the playful problems presented, contributing to the development of up-to-date, confident knowledge.

- Expanding IT knowledge in areas essential for everyday life

- Programming and algorithmic thinking — from introduction to advanced levels

- Developing logical and strategic skills

We combine mathematics and programming with board games such as chess and checkers, so that learning becomes not only useful but enjoyable as well.
