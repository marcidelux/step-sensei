Game and knowledge hand in hand.

We believe that playful learning motivates students far more effectively than traditional, often dry and monotonous frontal teaching.

Our goal is for students to become active participants in the learning process. Through interactive and engaging activities, we help them discover creative solutions to problems that often arise in real life as well.

At LogicInfo, we develop logical and strategic thinking in a playful way, encouraging our students to think out-of-the-box and solve problems creatively. By combining mathematics and programming with board games such as chess, we make learning not only useful but enjoyable too.
