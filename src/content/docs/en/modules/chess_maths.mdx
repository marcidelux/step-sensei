The Chess & Math module is a combination of logic, strategic thinking, and playfulness.

 Participants sit at small tables while learning the basics of chess and advanced strategies, all the while improving their problem-solving skills through mathematical puzzles.

The module also includes classic board games such as Nine Menâ€™s Morris, Checkers, Go, and Tic-Tac-Toe, giving participants a variety of logical challenges and the opportunity to playfully develop their concentration, strategic vision, and creativity. 

This module is ideal for those who are not yet ready to dive into the full digital program but still wish to develop their thinking skills in a fun and engaging way.
