## About me

In my twenties, I approached chess as a martial art. I believed that the “king of games” could be represented responsibly through a lifetime of learning. For years, I defined myself through competitive chess, with youth tournaments always on the horizon, striving to help my students succeed in national and international leagues. I coached at six world championships—from Greece to Montenegro, Russia to Egypt, and even the United Arab Emirates—each lasting two weeks. On a weekly basis, I followed the competitions and games of under-16 players, consulting regularly with my students to help them refine their strengths while navigating their opponents’ weaknesses.

By the time I turned 30, I realized that chess has earned the title “the king of games” not because of its competitive aspect, but because its power lies in its reflection of life itself. This insight led me to treat competitive chess as a secondary pursuit, allowing my colleagues and me to focus more on skill-building programs. At Veritas Academy, within the Boardgame curriculum, we have spent the past five years developing high school students’ decision-making and strategic thinking through chess and other board games.

Three years ago, I met Attila Krausz (Bom) from my favorite rap band. Our new friendship inspired me to integrate knowledge from my family background and hobbies into our educational programs. Immersed in creative circles, striving for mindfulness, and driven by inspiration, I introduced my close private students and Veritas students to our “polymath” approach, combining music, film, board games, drawing, and computer science into shared learning experiences.

The summer of 2025 brought fresh momentum to this vision, giving shape to what we now call Stepsensei: a movement to awaken consciousness, where we all become producers of our own lives, blending learning, awareness, and teaching into a single practice.
