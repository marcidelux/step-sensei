## About me
I spent many years abroad working in the field of data science at both small and large companies, and a few years ago I decided to focus instead on sharing my knowledge. I teach children and adults in computer science, mathematics, and chess. It is important to me to take a personalized approach with everyone, so that learning becomes not only more effective but also more enjoyable.
