## About me
My name is Mirka. I spent many years abroad (France, Belgium, the Netherlands, England, Brazil) in the world of data science, working on the mathematical optimization of airline operations and leading data science programs for logistics start-ups.

For a long time, I have felt that in the long run I would like to dedicate myself to something with a greater social impact, and I also wanted to give back to my home country. I have always seen learning as a path to progress, and I believe that children who grow up within a strong educational system are able to face life’s challenges more confidently and with greater balance.

A year ago, I decided that the time had come to start sharing my knowledge, and since then I have been teaching children and adults in the fields of computer science, logic, mathematics, and chess. It is important to me to connect with each individual, to find the method that makes problem-solving and critical thinking engaging, so that learning new skills becomes enjoyable and meaningful—skills that can remain valuable in the long term. I see this a bit like a good investment: it holds its value in a world that is constantly changing and where the future is uncertain. Knowledge, inner values, and experience, however, cannot be taken away—and I believe that all of these will yield returns many times over.
